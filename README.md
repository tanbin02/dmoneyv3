# Project Title: Automate a API by Postman & Newman

## Project Summary : 
In this project, I have automated a API to manage various financial operations and transactions using CRUD actions. The workflow includes an admin logging in and creating an agent along with two customers. The system deposits funds into the agent's account, who then deposits money into one customer's account. The agent's balance is verified, and the customer withdraws funds from the agent and checks their balance. This customer then transfers money to the second customer, who makes a payment to a newly created merchant account and reviews their balance and transaction statement. Finally, the merchant checks their balance. This project effectively covers essential financial operations, including deposits, withdrawals, transfers, payments, and balance inquiries, providing a comprehensive and streamlined simulation of a real-world fintech system.
